# Current Deductions

* Failed to address the LSP violation: -10 points 
* Did not implement stack / queue using the array class: -10 points

* As I discussed with you in class I went ahead and re-implemented the classes using inheritance part of the issue with second one was i misinterpreted a response you posted on the discussion forum as meaning the stack & queue couldn't use outside classes
but you actually mentioned libraries on there so I was at fault.
